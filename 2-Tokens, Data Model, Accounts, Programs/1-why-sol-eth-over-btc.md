## Why developers choose Sol/ETH over BTC to work with?

**Problem with Bitcoin:**

Bitcoin is one of the very first blockchains ever created. But this blockchain is basically (fully) focused on the "Decentralized Money" concept. This means you can't use it for any other purposes.

***For Example:***

Let's say you want to create a "Decentralized Ride Sharing App." To do this, you have to create your own blockchain. While creating your own blockchain, you need a lot of "Nodes" (also Miners) that will participate in the network and ultimately work on keeping the blockchain secure and active.

But the problem is, when starting off with a new blockchain, it's very hard to get "Nodes" to participate in the blockchain. This situation is called the "Cold Start Problem."

To solve this problem, "Ethereum" and "Solana" came into the picture.

### Why Ethereum/Solana:
Ethereum, first of all, is a well-established blockchain. It has a sophisticated and established network, with thousands of "Nodes" throughout the world continuously participating to keep the blockchain "Active" and "Secure."


Ethereum introduced the idea of "Deploying" other people's "Programs" into its (Ethereum's) own blockchain. Basically, Ethereum said, "Build your decentralized application on top of our blockchain, as it is well-furnished and secure. You don't have to worry about creating your own blockchain and dealing with the 'Cold Start Problem'.


**Smart Contracts:**

Ethereum allows others to run their "programs" in its blockchain. These programs can run through "Smart Contracts."

Ethereum was one of the first blockchains to introduce the concept of decentralized state/programs.
[Smart Contracts are backend applications deployed on Blockchain.]

Solana also works in a similar way but more efficiently.

    • In the Ethereum blockchain, these are known as Smart Contracts.
    • In the Solana blockchain, these are known as Programs.
